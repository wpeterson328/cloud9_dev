The cloud9 ubuntu default image comes with mysql already installed! Yay!
However! It only binds to 127.0.0.1 by default
If you want to connect to MySQL on a docker container running on your cloud9 instance there are a few different solutions
This stack overflow article is excellent

The quickest, but least secure, solution is to bind to 0.0.0.0

sudo vim /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf 

#change the bind-address to:
#bind-address            = 0.0.0.0

sudo service mysql restart

You can now connect to mysql from docker containers!

If you want to use phpmyadmin, you can now use it like this:
docker run --name myadmin -d -e PMA_HOST=$(hostname -i) -e PMA_USER=my_user -e PMA_PASSWORD=my_pass -p 8080:80 phpmyadmin

Then use the preview application in cloud9 to get to the web ui
